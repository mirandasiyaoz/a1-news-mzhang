## ‘Stone Journey’ at Worcester Art Museum raises questions of art ownership and value


We live in a time when wealthy collectors shell out hundreds of millions of dollars for a single artwork, placing seemingly unlimited value on them. But how does that compare with the value of the natural treasures that surround us and which is ultimately more important?

A new installation at Worcester Art Museum by internationally recognized artist Lee Mingwei poses those questions and asks us to think about what our ownership of anything actually means. Called “Stone Journey,” the installation is a simple one of just two objects, a small stone Lee collected from a New Zealand river and an exact replica he cast in bronze.

* Lee, a Taiwanese artist who now lives in Paris, is known for asking us to ponder the deeper significance of the seemingly mundane. He graduated from California College of Art, in the fine-arts-based textile program, and from Yale University, where he studied sculpture. His work has been shown all over the world, including at the Whitney Museum, MoMA, the Venice Biennale and, closer to home, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.

* Lee’s projects are usually ephemeral, thought-expanding projects in which he asks viewers to reach for a more expansive concept of everyday things such as mending, letter writing and even sleeping. His Mending Project, for example, involved having people bring items of clothing to a museum where Lee or a volunteer would invite the clothing bearer to sit and chat while the object was repaired. The goal was the conversation shared between mender and museum-goer, rather than merely being able to walk out with, say, newly sewn-up seams on shirt.

<blockquote>
″‘Stone Journey’ poses important questions about natural and artistic beauty by presenting a bronze replica alone with the original stone collected from the glacier-sculpted riverbanks of New Zealand. Which is more valuable? A natural object or one made by an artist? And what does it mean to possess an artwork as an object or as an idea? As part of owning the work, Lee requests that its collector eventually return to nature one of the pair, raising issues of ownership, control, value and loss.”
